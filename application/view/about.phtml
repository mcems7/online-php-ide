    <h3>Intro</h3>
    <p><a href="<?php echo _HTTP_ROOT?>/" title="Homepage">Online-php.com</a> is a <b>free online IDE</b> for editing files on an FTP server.<br>
    This web application is an <b>Open-Source project</b>, and the source can be downloaded from 
    <a href="<?php echo _HTTP_ROOT?>/source/">Our source download</a>.<br><br>
    </p>
    </li>
    
    <li>
    <h3>Purpose</h3>
    <p>
        The application was created for <b>fast, free, simple and convenient read/write access to the files on FTP server</b>.<br>
        Sometimes, for some purposes, the direct FTP access is blocked and there is no conventional way to access the files on the server.
        This is the main reason for this WebApp.
    </p>

    <h3>FAQ</h3>
    <p><b>1. Is this application secure, and how can I be sure that my passwords won't be stolen?</b></p>
    <p>
        The webApp is an open-source project, and the source code is being compressed and packed on-the-fly while pressing
        the "Download" key. This way, the code you download is identical to the code of the site.<br/>
        As you would see, this web application does not store any private data, code or files on the server, primarilly for security issues.<br />
        <br />
        This web application uses database only for storing textual data. Once you download and install the App on your server, 
        you can continue using it for your private use.<br />
    </p><br>
    <p><b>2. Is the application free?</b></p>
    <p>Yes, the application is absolutely free, you can download the source code and install on your server.<br/>
    You can submit bug reports, bug fixes or any other comments through the Contact Us form or directly to my Email (www.online.php@gmail.com).<br/>
    I would appreciate any help you can provide</p><br><br>

    <h3>Upgrade instructions</h3>
    <p>
        Currently there's no automatic upgrade application, but hopefully it will be developed in the near future.<br />
        <br />
        <b>For now, these are the steps for the upgrade:</b>
        <ul>
            <li><b>Important!!</b> - <u><b>Backup</b> your current application</u> - All the files, including the <b>/db/blog.sqlite.dat</b></li>
            <li><u><b>Download</b> the new version</u> of the application from the server</li>
            <li><u><b>Replace the content</b></u> of the current application directory with the new one.</li>
        </ul>
        <br />
        <br />
        * Please don't remove the PHP code which checks for updates from the server.<br/>
